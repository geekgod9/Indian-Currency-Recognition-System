Problem Statement :
To create an application for efficient and correct recognition of Bank Notes.
This project would be helpful in numerous fields to be its banking system or helping the blinds to detect which Bank Note is presented to him/her.
However, currency recognition systems that are based on image analysis entirely are not sufficient. Most of the present systems only recognize Banknotes which are not wrinkled. Due to this, they are not very effective to be used in real life.
Our system is based on image processing and makes the process automatic and robust.

Objectives :
The objective of this Intelligent Currency Recognition System is to analyze and detect a banknote fed to it as input and generate favorable output in an efficient manner by the use of Image Processing and Machine learning techniques.

1. To process and identify banknotes as inputted by the user in less time.
2. To propose a cost-effective solution to the problem of Currency recognition.
3. To efficient recognize banknotes with wear and tear with utmost accuracy.
4. To replace the outdated method of currency recognition with a more efficient and
effective system.
